- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MikeeyBikeey
- I'm interested in making games with all sorts of different tools.
You can have a look at the games I make by going over to my itch page: "https://mikeeybikeey.itch.io/".
Sometimes I enjoy modding other video games.
- Iâ€™m currently learning Rust and Godot, but I'm also interested in learning other tools that can aid with video game development.
I've used the following tools in the past: Game Maker Studio, Love2D, Godot, SFML, Raylib, tic80, C++, Rust, Lua, Python, Javascript, GDScript, and Game Maker Language.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on game jams hosted on itch.
- You can reach me by my email: MikeeyBikeey@gmail.com
